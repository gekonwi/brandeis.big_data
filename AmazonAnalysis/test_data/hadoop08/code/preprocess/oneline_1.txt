Disappointing. Item promptly quit working after taking out of box. I've read reviews of its limitations in 6" or more of snow, but I first used it after only 2" fell. Made only one pass and shovel stopped. I thought the problem may have been my extension cord, but it wasn't. Nor could I find any reset/overload switch anywhere on this snowthrower.
