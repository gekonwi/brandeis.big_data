My cat was tearing the box open. The Kitty Korner Komber comes with catnip and it must be better than the usual schwag. As soon as I put the Komber up though, he lost interest in the kitty weed. My cat is missing a hind leg and this product is perfect for him to scratch his face and side on. He uses on both sides of his body. He always rubs his face and sides of his mouth on the corners of everything and since the Komber feels so good, he uses it instead of the walls or furniture. I had a cat with all four legs who used it just as often. It's the one thing designed for cats that my cat will actually use. I have bought this product several times. It's hard to find in pet stores.
