Making his television debut in 1948, he quickly expanded to over 50 television appearances two years later. Nielsen made his film debut in 1956, and began collecting his roles in [[Drama film|dramas]], [[Western (genre)|westerns]], and [[romance film]]s between the 1950s and the 1970s. Nielsen's performance in the films ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' and ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'' received positive reviews as a serious actor, although he is primarily known for his comedic roles during the 1980s and the early 1990s.

Although Nielsen's acting career crossed a variety of genres in both television and films, his deadpan delivery in ''[[Airplane!]]'' marked a turning point in his career, one that would make him, in the words of film critic [[Roger Ebert]], "the [[Laurence Olivier|Olivier]] of spoofs."<ref name="Ebert">{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|authorlink=Roger Ebert|title=Scary Movie 3|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20031024/REVIEWS/310240305/1023|date=24 October 2003|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ue0sIuNQ|archivedate=1 December 2010}}</ref> Nielsen enjoyed further success with [[The Naked Gun|''The Naked Gun'' film series]], based on an earlier short-lived television series ''[[Police Squad!]]'' in which he also starred.

Nielsen married four times and had two daughters from his second marriage. Nielsen was recognized with a variety of awards throughout his career, and was inducted into the [[Canada's Walk of Fame|Canada]] and [[Hollywood Walk of Fame|Hollywood]] Walks of Fame.

Then I would take them home and show them 8-by-10 glossies, and things changed quite drastically. So I began to think that maybe this acting business was not a bad idea, much as I was very shy about it and certainly without courage regarding it.

His television appearances include parts in ''[[Justice (1954 TV series)|Justice]]'', ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', and ''[[The Wild Wild West]]''. In 1961, he was the lead in a taut Los Angeles police drama called ''[[The New Breed (TV series)|The New Breed]]''. He guest starred in a 1964 episode of ''[[Daniel Boone (TV series)|Daniel Boone]]'' with [[Fess Parker]] and, in a minor but credited role, [[Jay Silverheels]]. In 1968, he had a major role in the pilot film for the popular police series ''[[Hawaii Five-O]]'', and later appeared in one of the seventh season episodes. In 1969, he had the leading role as a police officer in ''[[The Bold Ones: The Protectors]]''.

In 1972, Nielsen appeared as the ship's captain in the all-star disaster epic ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]''. He also starred in the [[William Girdler]]-directed 1977 action film ''Project: Kill''. His last dramatic role before portraying mainly comedy roles was the 1979 Canadian disaster film ''[[City on Fire (1979 film)|City on Fire]]'' in which he played a corrupt mayor. In 1980, he guest starred as Sinclair on the [[CBS]] [[miniseries]] ''[[The Chisholms]]''.

===''Airplane!'' and ''The Naked Gun''===
{{Main|Airplane!|The Naked Gun}}
Nielsen's supporting role in 1980's ''[[Airplane!]]'' was a major watershed in his career. The ethos of the movie, a parody of dramatic disaster films such as ''[[Zero Hour!]]'' and ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'', is largely based on building a comedy around actors who were then known exclusively for their dramatic roles (other stars included [[Robert Stack]], [[Peter Graves]], and [[Lloyd Bridges]]). Nielsen was the movie's linchpin, his deadpan delivery contrasting with the continual absurdity surrounding him. When asked, "Surely you can't be serious?", he responds with a curt, "I am serious. And don't call me Shirley." In several interviews he later reflected on the significance of the comedic line: "I thought it was amusing, but it never occurred to me that it was going to become a trademark. It's such a surprise...the thing comes out, people say, 'What did he say?!'"<ref name="KJZZ">{{cite web|title=Leslie Nielsen Interview (Radio)|publisher=KJZZ 91.5 FM|url=http://kjzz.org/news/arizona/archives/200402/leslieneilsen|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ufWDXbYT|archivedate=2 December 2010}}</ref> Nielsen also stated that he was "...pleased and honored that [he] had a chance to deliver that line."<ref name="YahooNe"/> The comedic exchange was at #79 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]].<ref name="AFI">{{cite web|title=AFI.com|work=AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes|url=http://www.afi.com/100years/quotes.aspx|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ufWPg4p0|archivedate=2 December 2010}}</ref> The American Film Institute also included the film in its list of the top ten comedy films of all time.<ref name="MIL">{{cite news|last=Dudek|first=Duane|title=25 years and still laughing; Airplane!' maintains its cruising|work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]| url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=332493|accessdate=23 February 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080430053901/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=332493|archivedate=30 April 2008}}</ref>

Critics praised the film, which also proved to be a success with audiences.<ref name="RT1">{{cite web|title=Airplane! (1980)| work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/airplane/|accessdate=23 February 2009}}</ref> The film's directors, [[Jim Abrahams]], [[David Zucker (filmmaker)|David Zucker]], and [[Jerry Zucker (film director)|Jerry Zucker]], chose Nielsen for the role based on his ability to play "a fish in water", stating that "You could have cast funny people and done it with everybody winking, goofing off, and silly...we wanted people to be oblivious to the comedy."<ref name="MIL"/> For Nielsen, ''Airplane!'' marked a shift from dramatic roles to a new focus on [[deadpan|deadpan comedy]]. When it was suggested that his role in ''Airplane!'' was [[Typecasting (acting)|against type]], Nielsen protested that he had "always been cast against type before," and that comedy was what he always really wanted to do.<ref name="CastType">{{cite news|last=Dalton|first=Andrew|last2=Thomas|first2=Bob|title='Airplane!', 'Forbidden Planet' actor Nielsen dies|work=[[The Monitor (Texas)|The Monitor]]|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_OBIT_LESLIE_NIELSEN?SITE=TXMCA&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ufWUN5CO|archivedate=2 December 2010}}</ref>

The directors, interested in the success of the new comedy, decided to bring a similar style of comedy to television, casting Nielsen in the lead role in their new series, ''[[Police Squad!]]''. The series introduced Nielsen as [[Frank Drebin]], the stereotypical police officer modeled after serious characters in earlier police TV series.

''Police Squad'''s opening sequence was based on the 1950s cop show ''[[M Squad]]'', (which starred [[Lee Marvin]]), which opened with footage of a [[police car]] roving through an after-dark urban setting with a big band playing a jazz theme song in the background. The voice-over and the show's organization into "acts" with an epilogue was homage to [[Quinn Martin]] police dramas including ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'', ''[[Barnaby Jones]]'', ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]]'', and ''[[Cannon (TV series)|Cannon]]''. Much like in ''Airplane!'', Nielsen portrayed a serious character whose one-liners appeared accidental next to the pratfalls and sight gags around him. Although the show was quickly canceled, lasting only six episodes after being juggled between time slots, Nielsen received an ''[[Emmy Award]]''<ref>[http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/leslie-nielsen Leslie Nielsen Emmy Award Winner]</ref> nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series|Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series]].<ref name="BIO">{{cite web|title=Leslie Nielsen|publisher=[[The Biography Channel]]|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/150:519/1/Leslie_Nielsen.htm|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5ufWoKHlM|archivedate=2 December 2010}}</ref>

Non-comedic roles included ''[[Prom Night (1980 film)|Prom Night]]'' (1980) and ''[[Creepshow]]'' (1982), both horror films. His last dramatic role was as Allen Green, a violent john killed in self-defense by [[Barbra Streisand]]'s prostitute character, Claudia Draper, in [[Martin Ritt]]'s courtroom drama ''[[Nuts (film)|Nuts]]'' (1987).

Six years after the cancellation of ''Police Squad!'', its directors decided to make a feature length version for theaters. Titled ''[[The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!]]''. The film returned Nielsen to his role as Frank Drebin. It involved a comical scheme of a ruthless drug kingpin using hypnosis in an attempt to assassinate Queen [[Elizabeth II]]. Drebin, like the doctor in ''Airplane!'', seemed unaware of the absurdity around him even when unintentionally contributing toward it. Nielsen later said in an interview that he had done many of his own stunts, "You have an idea of how you're going to do something, and it's your vision... unless you do it, it really doesn't stand a chance."<ref name="KJZZ"/> This movie grossed over $78&nbsp;million at the box office and was well received by critics.<ref name="MOJO">{{cite web|title=The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=nakedgun.htm|accessdate=23 February 2009}}</ref><ref name="RT2">{{cite web|title=The Naked Gun – From the Files of Police Squad!

Nielsen briefly appeared on the World Wrestling Federation program in the summer of 1994 on ''[[WWE Raw|WWF Monday Night Raw]]''; capitalizing on his Frank Drebin character, Nielsen (and [[George Kennedy]]) were hired as "super-sleuths" to unravel the mystery of [[The Undertaker]] who had disappeared at January's [[Royal Rumble (1994)|Royal Rumble]] event. At [[SummerSlam (1994)|SummerSlam 1994]], in a ''Naked Gun'' parody, they were hot on the case (in fact, they were literally standing on a case). Although they did not actually find The Undertaker, the case had been closed (the literal case had been shut) and thus, they solved the mystery.<ref name=wcrap>{{cite book|title=Wrestlecrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling|last=Baer|first=Randy |coauthors=R.D.
